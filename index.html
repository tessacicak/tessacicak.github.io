My name is Tessa Cicak. I am the Digital Materials and Collections Researcher for Liberal Arts Technologies and Innovation Services at the University of Minnesota. I help students faculty and staff with digital scholarship. This can include managing their data, digitizing and orgizing collections and its related metadata, or assisting with larger scale projects.
